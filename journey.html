    <p>That's me again, Hi. Relying on just ourselves should be motivating and inspiring, but if like me you have days where you don't want to get up and do something that can change your life. Well, It's time to change this behavior. Are you in? </p>

    <div class="days">
      <h3>How I spend my days</h3>
      <p>
        I'm following a bland schedule just to get things done.<br> For example, sometimes I wake up at 7:30 AM, other times at 8:30 AM.<br> I have breakfast and then either read one of these<a href="post.html"> books</a> or work on creating and editing the blog you're reading.<br> I do this for hours until I have my second meal.<br> After that, I either continue 'working' or sometimes I get lazy and just lay on the bed.<br> In the afternoon, I either go to the gym or keep working on the code.<br> On Wednesdays and Sundays, I also clean my room.<br> That's basically how I'm currently spending my days.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="procrastination">
      <h3>But all that glitters is not gold</h3>
      <p>
        Those are the typical days when I'm super determined to get things done. But it's never always like this.<br> When I feel it isn't the right day, I procrastinate more than I work. While I work, I find ways to avoid doing anything productive.<br> I should spend a month with the dear David Goggins.<br> I must train my mind better and focus more on the quality of my work rather than the quantity.<br> It has been a tragic year at the gym, but I'll explain that in another <a href="post3.html">post.</a>

    <div class="family">
      <h3>What happens when you're in a middle-class family</h3>
      <p>
        In the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3Sh620e">"Rich Dad Poor Dad,"</a> Robert Kiyosaki defines the word 'job' as an acronym for <i>'Just Over Broke.'</i><br> I found it funny and very interesting because, in my opinion, it's true.<br> My whole family has always been on that little string where if they fell, we would be poorâ€”not extremely poor, but poor.<br> They tell me that real life is different from what I want to become, and the only thing to do is find a safe job and live paycheck to paycheck.<br> My dad, who has worked in a car wash since he was a child, thinks that the home we live in is an asset.<br> Unlike Robert Kiyosaki, my dad doesn't have a real education.<br> You may think, 'Why is this kid just telling that his parents are poor and crying?'<br> I'm saying this because I want to let you know where is my starting point, and maybe you could be in the same situation as me.<br> I hope you can understand why I'm doing this.

    <div class="books">
      <h3>Many books on Self-Improvement mirror your own life</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the books I've read (which you can also get from this<a href="entrepreneurs.html"> post</a>) are so close to my life that I was really impressed by them.<br> I think that when you experience firsthand what you read in a self-improvement book, you can understand it better and faster, and implementing the concepts becomes easier.<br> <a href="https://amzn.to/3zOKNwx">"Atomic Habits"</a> taught me a great lesson on habits, and I'm very grateful for that.<a href="https://amzn.to/4c7Dr4J"><br> "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie</a> was very useful; I'm not going to hide that I've tried some of the psychological tricks, and they worked.<br><a href="https://amzn.to/3zS8qEo"> "Think and Grow Rich"</a> was a great read; it gave me the reason to start doing something about my financial position.<br><a href="https://amzn.to/3y9hHHx"> "Can't Hurt Me"</a> was a masterpiece of literature; it should replace school books.<br> The next book I'm going to read is <a href="https://amzn.to/3LRwbzf">"Blue Ocean Strategy."</a><br> I heard of this book when I was searching on YouTube for good books on investing, but I don't know anything more about it.

    <div class="motivational">
      <h3>How do I procrastinate?</h3>
      <p>
        I know it's dumb to talk about the same thing in two different paragraphs, but here I am.<br> I didn't remember what I wanted to talk about, so here we are.<br> The things I do every time I don't want to work include:<br> watching motivational videos on luxury lifestyles and testosterone booster gym videos, watching interviews with multi-millionaires, watching funny moments of the Tate brothers, watching some animes, walking around the rooms, and watching sports news.<br> Sometimes I remember that I should be doing something better and throw my phone away, knowing it won't break.<br> That's very pathetic, I know. I must throw wood on the fire, not water.<br> Once I realize that I should have done it and didn't, I'll regret it immensely.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3>Last things</h3>
      <p>
        I talk too much when I'm alone, and I'm a good listener when I'm not alone.<br> If you know someone who just listens to all your problems and doesn't talk until you finish talking, he or she is a valuable person.<br> I listen to all the problems, but in the end, I will be submerged by other people's problems plus my own.<br> We have to reach the top so we don't have to listen to the small problems of small people, allowing us to resolve just our bigger problems as big people.
