    <h2>In a world of bosses, we need leaders</h2>
   <p>Being a boss is easy, just be ruthless with your employees in every way possible, but no one will feel bad when your time has come.<br> While being a leader is harder but it's much more rewarding, learn to be an example for your employees and make them feel important to you.<br> There will be huge benefits for great leaders, now you have to choose which one you want to become.

    <h3>1. What's a Leader</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to start by saying that this is my personal opinion and how I would act as a leader.<br> Everyone has their own definition of leadership, and here I'm going to try to explain mine.<br> A leader is at the top thanks to his charisma and the ability to inspire others to follow him.<br> He isn't the best at everything but can overcome anything with the support of his teammates.<br> The leader I want to become is someone who helps his teammates achieve their goals and inspires them to improve themselves. "Leader" is a fantastic word not solely because of what it means.<br> It's very hard to become a leader, but the reward of becoming one is the journey itself.<br> Becoming a leader means studying real leaders and practicing with real people, not just puppets.

      <h3>2. How to manage people</h3>
      <p>
        There are many types of people, and you have to learn how to manage each one of them.<br> How? Simply by recognizing their type.<br> For example:
        <ol>
          <li>High motivation, low skills.</li>
          <li>Low motivation, high skills.</li>
          <li>High motivation, high skills.</li>
          <li>Low motivation, low skills.</li>
        </ol>
      You may think, "I need only the third type of people, and I'm done."<br> It's the easiest thing to think, and you're right, but you must at least learn to improve the first two types of people, and it isn't that simple.<br> The first type, "High motivation, low skills," needs to gain experience.<br> You can pair them with the second type, "Low motivation, high skills,"<br> but you have to do more for the second type because just seeing a motivated person won't completely help them.<br> What you have to do is give them challenges and let them inspire you by giving them <i>carte blanche&#42;</i>.<br> Let them work on a project they like; they may surprise you in the end.<br> The third type, "High motivation, high skills," is like a divine blessing. I hope you can find them because it's complicated.<br> You have to keep them as long as possible; no one knows what they really think about, so watch out.

      <h3>3. Low motivation, low skills.</h3>
      <p>
        This type needs a full paragraph.<br> "Low motivation, low skills" are people who, due to their lack of skill, lose motivation.<br> They don't need empathy; they need to be involved in group projects more often and need easy to medium difficulty tasks.<br> Once their work becomes recognized, they'll start to try to do more and improve themselves on their own.<br> They need approval and a great push to start. You don't have to be too aggressive, or they'll quit.<br> In my opinion, this type can become the third more easily than the first two combined, but they need a bit of time and effort to get there.

    <div class="point4">
      <h3>4. Everyone can become a leader</h3>
      <p>
        You <mark>can</mark> become a leader, but if you don't want to, that's absolutely fine.<br> A leader has a lot of responsibilities, and if you don't like having pressure on yourself, it's better not to be a leader. <br><mark>However</mark>, becoming a leader can be very satisfying, and if you can overcome your own fears,<br> you would already be a better leader than one who is born with that skill.<br> Even in another context, Tom "The Quadfather" Platz said:<br> <mark><strong>"I'll not be a victim of my genetics; my genetics will be a victim to me."</strong></mark><br> All you have to do is choose between being a <mark>follower</mark> or a <mark>leader.</mark>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3>Last things</h3>
      <p>
        I'm introverted, but I don't want to work for anyone except myself. For this sole reason, I'm going to become a leader.<br> Where you and I aim to be, there are only leadersâ€”people who didn't want to follow a boss, people who don't accept mediocrity.<br> They wanted to be in that niche.<br> If you read my posts, you want to get to that niche; there's no turning back.<br> I'm not saying that following someone is bad, only following a boss is bad; they just aren't leaders.<br> If you want to follow someone, follow a leader.

      <h3>Personal Advice</h3>
      <p>
        I mention this in every post: I'm a beginner, and you have the right not to follow such advices,<br> but if you find it helpful, I would be very glad to hear from you.<br> I'm writing these posts for those who want to understand how to change their lives but don't know how to do it.<br> My journey and the things I say are the result of an obsession.<br> I read books, watch videos, and now I'm trying to do something.<br> So understand that I'm not an example of someone who has already succeeded but of someone who's trying to make it happen.
