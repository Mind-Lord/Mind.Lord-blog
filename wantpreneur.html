  <h2>Don't wait for the right pick</h2>
<p>You choose what can work for you, don't wait for the right one coming up to you.<br> If you don't have already the skill,whatever it is, take time to learn it and then just try it.<br> Give yourself 2 weeks to learn the skill and then create a plan on how to monetize it, once you have done it, give yourself one month to show it to the world.<br> Just try and let me know, ok?</p>

<h3>Personal experience</h3>
   <p>
     What I told you above is what I've done, nothing more. At the start of June this year, I began searching for something that could fit me.<br> After having tried almost nothing, I decided to learn by watching YouTube videos of 5+ hours on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which, to be honest, I didn't fully understand.<br> I watched these videos for two and a half weeks and tried to implement what was being taught.<br> I won’t hide the fact that I only understood HTML and CSS, but this didn't stop me from trying to create a basic website.<br> I started with this <a href="guide.html">post</a>, and although I was 'helped' by the other two members of my team, whom you can get to know better on the<a href="about.html"> About page</a>,<br> I was the one most determined to create this website. In fact, every page, except that one, was made by me alone.
   </p>
  </div> 

  <div class="website">
    <h3>The creation of the website</h3>
    <p>
      I know it isn't the best-looking website, but I focused most of my efforts on the content.<br> I worked on it from June 17th to July 20th, creating one page per day. While working on new pages, I also edited the old ones.<br> The week before publication was the hardest because I had to create the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions pages.<br> These needed to be customized with the website URL, which was quite stressful.<br> I don't know if this website will bring me any money; the plan was to share my journey and potentially earn a small percentage from affiliate commissions.<br> It might not work, but if it does, you'll see everything with full transparency on my Instagram&#42;.
    </p>
    <small>&#42;overall_small</small>
  </div>

  <div class="monetization">
    <h3>How does it work</h3>
    <p>
      Full transparency: I have applied for Amazon Associates, and if you buy the books mentioned in this <a href="entrepreneurs.html">post</a>,<br> I will earn a commission from the sale without any extra cost to you. I've only applied for this program.<br> If I earn anything additional, I'll inform you either on Instagram or through another post on the site.<br> I want to succeed and prove that you can too by following my journey.<br> I won’t hide anything because if I can make it with full transparency, no one can make videos like 'Luigi Longobardo exposed' or anything like that.<br> I don't want you to be arrogant or greedy; you might succeed while I might not, even if you followed me, but that's part of the journey.<br> I'm not saying you have to tell everyone everything; there's nothing wrong with keeping some things to yourself.<br> But if you want to share something, just do it.
  </div>

  <div class="conclusion">
    <h3>Last things</h3>
    <p>
      There are people you just hate and don’t want to reveal anything to, and that’s completely fine.<br> My family tells me, 'Don't say anything to anyone.' In my opinion, people don’t care unless you've already succeeded.<br> I’ve shared my plan with some people, but they didn’t care; I was just talking to people who weren’t interested.<br> Normal people can’t understand our point of view, sitting in a sports car with our spouse, both dressed up<br>—they call us dreamers and say, 'You don’t know anything about real life, get a job.'<br> I just hate those people. I tell them how simple life can be now, but all they do is complain.<br> So if you want to share your opinion on this topic with like-minded people, just do it because others don’t see what God showed you.<br> It’s understandable not to take advice from a beginner, but if you’re facing issues during your journey, mine also involves helping you.
