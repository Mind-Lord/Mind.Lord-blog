<h2>Longobardo Luigi</h2>
    <p>For who doesn't know me, I'm the one who's experiencing Self-Improvement on his own  skin. Let's start with when I first approached Self-Improvement. </p>

<div class="first-time">
    <h3>My first time</h3>
    <p>Not really the first time you may think, anyway I was turning 15 year old and I had my heart broken in a very bad way and started to hit the gym. <br> I wasted the most precious time to get the most of the newbie gains and in fact I have still an average physique&#42;, <br> I started dieting at the same time and it was the only thing I was doing perfectly. <br> I was so motivated and inspired by fitness influencers that I barely skipped workouts. <br> If you want to know, I'm part of the ones who wanted a 6-pack and almost never trained them,<br> because being the same size of a fridge in lean muscle mass is definitely better.</p>

</div>
    <div class="fap">
    <h3>How I dealt with daily fapping</h3>
    <p>Yes, I'm still ashamed of myself. Days spent with my phone in my other hand, just for temporary pleasure. <br> Very disgusting you may think, and you're right, but it's finally over. <br> I've been almost 2 years without touching myself and I fucked up everything on May 14th. <br> But this was the last time I promise, I won't fall in temptation because God is with me and even if He is disappointed,<mark> I'm not going to leave Him ever again.</mark></p>
      
</div>
    <div class="routines">
    <h3>Routines</h3>
    <p>I've already told you something on the other <a href="guide.html">post</a> on routines, anyway I don't follow any particular routine. <br> I just started setting daily goals this summer, I write them on a small notebook on the same day or the day before and I still don't clear all of them. <br> I hate doing nothing, but sometimes I get up from the chair where I'm working or learning and lay on the bed and watch the roof for even hours!</p>
      
</div>
    <div class="business">
    <h3>Business</h3>
    <p>I have an idea it's similar to a plan, I don't know if it can work for me, but if you can see this website it means that it can work. <br> I'm not going to give details here, but I's like a chain of causes and effects, it's all linked. <br> I don't think it's going to be easy to achieve a decent wealth with this plan, <br> because much more people are better than me and since I've seen them doing it, I think luck will do a big part if I succeed. <br> Either way I'm going to build something that can work for me and can make me successful, <br>because I'm not going to stay in my current position for the rest of my life, I must reach the top 1%.</p>
      
</div>
    <div class="goals">
    <h3>Where Do I Aim to be?</h3>
    <p>I'm going to reach the top 1%, I want to meet the people I admire and spend time with them, <br> I want to drive luxury cars, I want beatiful homes everywhere, I don't want to work for anyone else except myself. <br> I want to achieve greatness, my family doesn't share my goals, but I'm going to show up with a beatiful wife, in an expensive suit, <br> driving cars that have a value of so much they can't even imagine. <br> I don't call these dreams, I call them goals, dreams are for kids and I'm a man with goals, that's why I'm going to achieve every single one of them,<strong><br> no matter what.</strong>
    </p>

    </div>
    <div class="books">
    <h3>Books I've read</h3>
    <p>I've read a few of the books of the other <a href="entrepreneurs.html">post</a> and I've tried to explain what I've read in the most simple way I knew, for the others I admit it I've asked ChatGPT, I haven't bought them yet but they're on the shopping list. <br> I've read <a href="https://amzn.to/3Sh620e" target="_blank">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/4d8mM1H" target="_blank">Atomic Habits</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3zY6KJg" target="_blank">Think and Grow Rich</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/46fxgdd" target="_blank">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a>,<br> <a href="https://amzn.to/46b1cao" target="_blank">Can't Hurt Me </a>(italian version), <a href="" target="_blank">How to Win the Game of Life</a> and I'm currently reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3Lz4vyE" target="_blank">The Psychology of Money</a>. <br> I've learnt a lot, I hope I can put what I've learned in practice as soon as possible. <br> Unfortunately there were some concepts I didn't fully understood but I'm going to read them again to understand them better.
    </p>
      
</div>
    <div class="conclusion">
    <h3>Last things</h3>
    <p>I've written everything I minded to show you how I'm going to live and where I personally started. <br> There's nothing wrong with sharing your goals, especially if they match with the goals of someone else who's like minded. <br> Don't worry about the ones that don't understand, because I'm with you, I'm a Mr Nobody right now, <br> but I'll just say <b>'Start, whatever does make sense to you and succeed'.</b> <br>Write them anywhere, or just think about them daily, put in the work, find what you want and a way on how to achieve it. <br>Burnout doesn't exist, it's just your mind quitting like when you're training hard.</p>
