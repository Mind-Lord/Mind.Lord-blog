    <h2>How can we say that?</h2>
    <p>Just think about it for about a minute before you start reading. Done? Great. If you have thought about it, you may think that's just ridiculous. Well, let me explain. </p>

    <h3>1. There is no real reward at the end</h3>
    <p>
      Okay you can think that I just went crazy. I've already told you how I wanted to end up with. <br> But once we've arrived to the end point, we shouldn't stop, <br> we have to go for more and all we're going to do is just start another journey to climb the top. <br> In the book I'm currently reading <a href="" target="_blank">The Psychology of Money</a>, we must know when for every one of us <mark>enough is enough.</mark> <br> But after a few chapters, it tells us to embrace a journey not for reaching the top but to stay there. <br> So, we don't need to be greedy, we have to aim for what's still possible to achieve, <br> either way we're going to end up in a very bad way, not necessarily dead.

      <h3>2. Too many advices will confuse you</h3>
      <p>
If you've just started Self-Improvement and already listened to a lot of advices from successful people, <br> I'm not going to tell you that's wrong, I'm learning from them too,<br>but listening to a lot of people who sometimes tell different things from the others will just confuse you.<br> I'm not saying that you have to listen to me, because I'm a beginner too,<br> but what I've understood is that you have to think with your mind the way you want to succeed.<br> What you need to know is what does make sense to you and if you can make a lot of money with that, <br> but this is<mark> only up to you</mark> whether it is the right way for you or not.

      <h3>3. The biggest example is the gym</h3>
      <p>
        The journey in this case is even greater than the reward, once you've achieved your dream physique you have to keep it, how?<br> Well, by keep training hard or you'll lose it.<br> It's really like a business, but when we're talking about making money and keeping them, it seems absurd to achieve wealth.<br> The key word is <mark><i>'Consistency'</i></mark>, when learning the new skill that you chose to become your main/side hustle to make money,<br> you may think 'Wow, this isn't difficult' but then you have to refine your skill and that is harder.<br> When I started to learn to write some code by watching Youtube videos, I was surprised at how easy it was. <br> But when I started developing this website, I could do only what I've learned and in fact the site has been built with very basic coding.<br> I'm going to be honest, if the plan I made works even barely enough, I'm going to hire a real developer to make it better. <br> It doesn't mean that I don't want to learn to code and improve it myself,  but if I want to be a successful entrepreneur,<br> I need people to work for me and optimize the time and the quality of the work. <br> I'm not afraid of paying someone handsomely if the work they do is really good. <br> I don't want employees, I want <mark>co-workers</mark> but that doen't mean I'm not going to be a <mark>leader</mark>, <br> <i>the hierarchy must be respected</i> but <mark>I'm not the boss, there's difference between a boss and a leader</mark>. <br> I'm going to explain it in another <a href="leadership.html">post</a>.

      <h3>4. The journey is the reward</h3>
      <p>
        Now is the time to talk about the real reward, the journey. <br> In the case you hitted the rock bottom and then started to improve, if you could watch your rise from a graph like the stock market's,<br> you would be proud of yourself right? <br>  Well, you haven't accomplished anything yet, but you feel rewarded for the sacrifices you made to reaching there. <br> Once you've reached the next stage, you'll feel even prouder but that's merit to the journey. <br> When you're going to stop and there will be no journeys, <br><mark> you're going to feel that something belongs to you but it is missing,</mark> because this will happen.<br> I think you can answer yourself why is that. <br>Only if you're going to have trouble to answer you can contact me on instagram&#42; and I'll give you an hint.

      <h3>Last things</h3>
  <p>
    I hope that you can find your way to succeed, with no journey there is no end and with that no reward.<br> I can't basically give such advices because I've got no real experience, but if it does make sense for someone who wants to do something but doesn't know how to act, I'm documenting my journey on social media and I'll be very glad to help for that little I can do.<br> I'm going to talk honestly about my journey, I don't want that other people have difficult times when they're really trying,<br> so full transparency and full honesty.
