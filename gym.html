    <h2>When it went all wrong</h2>
    <p>My self-improvement journey started when I joined the gym. It all changed then; the reason made me hit rock bottom. Now, I prefer pain because it's the realest feeling. What about you?</p>

    <h3>First started</h3>
    <p>
      I joined the gym in March of 2022. I turned 15 in May. I felt the most amount of pain because it never happened before;<br> I was hiding my real feelings from everyone. I was at rock bottom, the worst of humankind. I felt that I needed to take my vengeance.<br> I was so focused and motivated that I barely skipped workouts; nothing else mattered anymore. I wanted to become the best.<br> I was a beginner and didn't know how to train hard, so I spent the first 10 months understanding how to train well enough to start my comeback.<br> The first 1.5 years weren't bad; I increased my strength and was able to achieve failure more often.<br> I know that exercise scientists will criticize me, but I worked out for about 4 hours just because I wasted time talking to gym bros and rested between sets without a timer.<br> It sounds strange and unnatural, but it worked even with highs and lows. The 1.5 years I spent at my first gym were really good, but then...

    <div class="second-year">
      <h3>The tragic year at my second gym</h3>
      <p>
        After an argument with the owner of the first gym, I left and searched for a new gym that could satisfy my needs.<br> In Italy, the term 'gym' means a place of a minimum of 40 square meters with some machines, dumbbells, and other stuff.<br> After visiting two gyms that weren't up to American standards, I went to one that was meant to be a functional training gym, but there are:<br> 3 benches, 2 rack for squat without safety bars and Technogym's machines like 1 leg extension, 1 seated leg curl, cables, 1 leg press, 1 lat machine, 2 treadmills, 1 cyclette and 1 elliptical machine.<br> It's the definition I gave you above of what 'gyms' are in Italy. My dad pays a monthly fee of €70 for a gym that has a value of €30.<br> The owner isn't the same as the other one, who was just greedy; the fee was €60, but the value was the same.<br> So here we are, in a gym that I didn't like from the beginning.<br> There weren't people who knew how to train, and they weren't people who would sacrifice some blood in the gym.<br> The people who knew how to train went to other gyms. I don't care if I am the only one slamming weights and screaming when achieving failure.

    <div class="anecdote">
      <h3>Little anecdote from the first gym</h3>
      <p>
        After I had been at the gym for a year, I had a heavy leg session, which meant heavy squats.<br> I have very strong legs compared to my upper body's strength.<br> I loaded my usual 95kgs (209lbs) and started my descent to parallel for, I think, 6 to 8 reps.<br> But then I couldn't get up, and the barbell fell on the safety bars.<br> My head felt heavy, and during the set, I was about to throw up; it was just rushing up my throat.<br> The very next day at school, I had nosebleeds at least twice a day. I thought, 'F*ck, I love it.'<br> I wasn't happy about the nosebleeds—they were the annoying part.<br> What I loved was the fact that it happened because of the heavy squat session.<br> The negative part was that I couldn't lift heavy for the next 3 months.<br> But when I didn't have nosebleeds for 2 days, I lifted heavy again, and then the nosebleeds returned.<br> I did this for about 5 months and then stopped because I was really tired of the nosebleeds.<br> I just took some vitamin C supplements prescribed by the doctor.

    <div class="supplements">
      <h3>What supplements do I take?</h3>
      <p>
        The answer to this question is: None. I don't take supplements.<br> My nutritionist says that food is all I need, and for someone who trains 3x a week, supplements like protein powder, amino acids, vitamins, etc., are not needed.<br> Maybe in a stalemate, he will give me at least creatine monohydrate.<br> In the bulk phase, which we started in February, maybe he could change something because in May, I couldn't eat as much as I did 3 months before—I felt immediately full.<br> In June, we started my first cut after the first bulk. I still train abs when I remember, but I don't know my BMI because the next check is on September 3rd.<br> I just know that I've lost 2kgs, and I hope it's only fat.<br> Dieting is the simple part of the game, but sometimes it's just hard to take another bite.<br> I can't understand the thing I'm going to explain in the next paragraph. Keep reading.
      </p>
      </div>

    <div class="highs-lows">
      <h3>The highs and lows</h3>
      <p>
        It happened in my first year and still happens, but I can't understand why I lose muscle mass and how I gain it.<br> I know all the processes, but I don't understand when one happens and when the other does, even if I do the same things every time.<br> I mean, I try to achieve failure or near it on a lot of exercises.<br> On a good part of them, I can, and on the last exercises, I feel so tired that doing another exercise seems impossible.<br> I don't have DOMS, and I know that it doesn't necessarily mean I've trained well, but simply I don't understand why I lose muscle or gain it.<br> Can someone explain it to me on my Instagram&#42;?

<div class="training">
  <h3>The actual reason of the tragic year</h3>
  <p>
    I know I should have written it in the paragraph above, but other things rushed to my mind.<br> In a few words, after I joined the new gym for 6 months, I lost all the muscle mass I gained in the 1.5 years—it was about 3 to 4 kgs.<br> I wanted to change it immediately, but then I spoke with one of the guys who worked there.<br> I told him that if I didn't gain the muscle mass I lost by June, I would change gyms.<br> He was the one who trained harder than anyone.<br> So from February to June, the rhythm changed, and I could gain back the muscle mass I lost. Not every pound, but I gained it back.<br> This was the last time I would go to a gym where for half a year, I lose everything, and which qualitatively isn't better than the previous one.
  </p>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3>Last things</h3>
      <p>
        It has been 2.4 years since I joined the gym, and I have experienced a lot of things.<br> Maybe the last is a great injury that I prefer not to ever have because mentally, it would be devastating. I don't want to stop.<br> I can keep training if I break an arm or a leg. I can keep training if I break something that is useless during training.<br> I don't care; I won't stop.<br> Self-improvement f&#42;cked my mind up in a positive manner, and I can't imagine going back to who I was before it.
