  <p class="introduction">
        We're a team of three 17-year-olds trying to inspire others to start their journey of improving their lives and achieving remarkable success. <br> Our posts aim to encourage as many people as possible to start changing their lives by taking us as an example. <br> We're still in high school and have learned some basic coding just by watching videos on YouTube. <br> Yes, we could just use a webpage builder like WordPress or Wix, <br> but create something from absolute scratch is a lot more fun, valuable and challenging. <br> We didn't know anything on how to code, zero, we've just seen videos <br> and sometimes we ask ChatGPT to help us do something more interactive. <br> But once we've learnt we're going to do everything ourselves. 
    </p>
    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Longobardo Luigi (Me)</strong>
            <p>I'm the most obsessed of the group with achieving success. Of course, I haven't achieved it yet, but I'm working on it, just as you should. <br> I've created the most of the website, in case you would insult someone. (I know it sucks)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cesarano Alfonso ("The Developer")</strong>
            <p>Well, he should be the developer. Theoretically, he just helped me build the page for the first <a href="post.html">Post</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>D'Ambrosio Armando</strong>
            <p>He was just on the call. He is better at other types of business; he's more about physical products than digital.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Mind.Lord?</h2>

    <p class="mindlord">
      Mind.Lord is where you can find the information you need to become the Lord of your thoughts. <br> You may not need or want this information, and you have every right to ignore it. <br> However, if you are facing problems during your journey, you can check our page to help yourself solve them. <br> We created it specifically for this purpose. <br> We may not have enough experience and we're not the best at what we do at our age, but at least we're trying. <br> So, if you're reading this and later see us succeed, you can remember where we started.

    <h2>In conclusion</h2>

    <p class="end">
        Now that you know briefly who we are, I hope you understand that there's nothing special about us. <br> You can start like we did. I told the other two members that we had to start doing something now, <br> and even if they found it funny, they began doing it. In the first <a href="post.html">Post</a>, <br> I've left some comments. I hope you've read them; if you haven't, please check them out. <br> We're guys from Italy, so I hope you find this more motivating and that you can start your journey. <br> If you find it interesting, we would love for you to keep following us.
